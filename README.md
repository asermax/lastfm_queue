lastfm_queue - Rhythmbox's dynamic queue based on LastFM recommendations.
========================================================================

This plugin is a port from Alexandre Rosenfeld's plugin, to support the Rhythmbox 2.x new plugin architecture.

This plugin will add an option to dinamically build up your playing queue, based on the songs you play. 
Each time you play a new song, it'll look for recommendations from LastFM and randomly choose from the songs you have on your library and match the recommendations, to add them to the current playing queue. All you gotta do is activate it from the toolbar.

Installation
-----------
To install, just execute the install.sh script (this will install the plugin locally, it will only be available for the current user).
The installation script will ask for admin password to install the glib-schema used to save the plugin status.

TODO: enable global installation (for all users).

Use
---
This plugins doesn't need further configuration after enabling it. Just activate it and enjoy.
